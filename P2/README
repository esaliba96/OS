1. SRJN deliver the same turnaround time as FIFO in case the workloads have equal burst times and/or the arrival times are very disperse with increasing burst times. Every time a new job comes in, the remaining time of the previous job will be smaller therefore the previous job will terminate before the next job starts.

2. SRJN and RR will have the same turnaround in case the quantum is larger than any job and the jobs arrive in an increasing order.

3. With SRJN, as the jobs lengths increase, the response time increases as well.

4. As quantum increases, the response time will increase as well. Jobs will have to wait longer before they can be processed. An equation that demonstrates is W = q(n-1) where W is the response time. Q the number of processes and n number or jobs.
